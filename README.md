# Glick
Glickcrypt, otherwise known as Glick, is an all-encompassing program which pulls together my "xTREEM" encryption and decryption programs under 1 central, unified umbrella. While the code for encryption/decryption processing is identical, there are minor changes to the behavior of the programs so that they function in this new suite.

DEPENDENCIES
Glickcrypt uses many integrated python modules, such as SYS, TIME, etc. However, it uses PyEnchant for the decryption processes.
