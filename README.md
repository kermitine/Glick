# Glick
Glickcrypt, otherwise known as Glick, is an all-encompassing program which pulls together my "xTREEM" encryption and decryption programs under 1 central, unified umbrella. While the code for encryption/decryption processing is identical, there are minor changes to the behavior of the programs so that they function in this new suite.
